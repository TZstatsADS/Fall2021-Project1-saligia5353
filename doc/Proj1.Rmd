Just imagine that: you are innocent about philosophy and one day you drop the 
flashcards of your girlfriend uses for preparing PPE quiz by accident. The 
flashcards are organized by each school of thought, and you have to recover
them before she notices the condition.

It's *Mission: Impossible*, isn't it? Even though for those who knows a little
about philosophy, it's still *The Bourne Identity*. To be frank, that's exactly
my first impression of the work clouds at the beginning. Describe each school's
thought through word clouds? You're asking a cook to make a Coq au vin based
on Le Coq gaulois.

Notice that I'm not try to make objections on the common utility of word cloud. 
Word cloud is epochal, especially dealing with speeches or questionnaires, the 
data less academic and time dependent. The content of such text is less complicated.
After removing stop words, the truths come out, in the order of significance. Nevertheless, for philosophy data, the utility of word cloud is
suspect.

How do we open the history of philosophy with data?

This article aims to set up a connection between time/school and philosophy 
works for general audience. Do more recent works have a longer sentence on average 
than the classical ones? Do they criticize the classical or contemporary works 
more frequently? Is there a cluster of certain schools which compares 
works from 
others more? Wait a minute, and let me take you there.

```{r, include=FALSE}
philosophy <- read.csv("../data/philosophy_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(title = factor(title),
         author = factor(author),
         school = factor(school))

apply(philosophy, 2, function(x) any(is.na(x)))

# This article will not focus on the sentimental analysis or the topic modeling,
# so we only select certain columns. The new dataset will be saved as
# "philosophy_selected.csv" under the output folder.
philosophy_selected <- philosophy %>%
  select(title:school, original_publication_date:corpus_edition_date,
         sentence_lowered, sentence_length) %>%
  rename(original_publication = original_publication_date,
         corpus_edition = corpus_edition_date,
         sentence = sentence_lowered,
         length = sentence_length)

write.csv(philosophy_selected, 
          file = "../output/philosophy_selected.csv",row.names=FALSE)

rm(philosophy)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
datatable(sample_n(philosophy_selected, 150),
          options = list(autowidth = TRUE))
```

As the proverb goes, seeing is believing. For general audience, I believe it 
necessary to have a brief introduction to the dataset, via an interactive example.
Hence, here I take a random sample containing 150 records from the original
dataset, and you can have a surfing using the table above in any ways you prefer, 
but whatever the sample includes, it's always not difficult to see that the
length of sentence really varies. **This phenomenon motivates the article.**
Compared with the abstract, sophisticated content, we're more interested in the neat
analysis related to concrete number.

Nevertheless, we need to dig into more details of the relations among author, 
school, and work firstly. It's absolutely possible for one author to have multiple
works; it's also possible for one school to have multiple authors, but is there 
any author who corresponds to multiple schools? This sounds not possible, but we
need to have a check. If there is, the case will be more complicated.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
title_amount <- philosophy_selected %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  summarize(title_amount = n_distinct(title)) %>%
  arrange(desc(title_amount))
write.csv(title_amount, 
          file = "../output/title_amount.csv",row.names=FALSE)

author_amount <- philosophy_selected %>%
  group_by(school) %>%
  summarize(author_amount = n_distinct(author)) %>%
  arrange(desc(author_amount))
write.csv(author_amount, 
          file = "../output/author_amount.csv",row.names=FALSE)

g1 <- ggplot(title_amount, aes(x=author, y=title_amount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  xlab("author") + ylab("amount of works") +
  coord_flip()
ggsave("g1.png", path="../figs")

g2 <- ggplot(author_amount, aes(x=school, y=author_amount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  xlab("school") + ylab("amount of authors") +
  coord_flip()
ggsave("g2.png", path="../figs")

ggarrange(g1, g2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

rm(title_amount); rm(author_amount); rm(g1); rm(g2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
school_amount <- philosophy_selected %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  summarize(school_amount = n_distinct(school))
write.csv(school_amount, 
          file = "../output/school_amount.csv",row.names=FALSE)

kable(school_amount, caption = "How many schools does each author correspond?")

rm(school_amount)
```

Fortunately, only author-work and school-author are one-to-multiple relation. 
All users in the database are only assigned in one school. Hence, We can jump to 
the next stage, **the first question**, do more recent works have a longer 
sentence on average than the classical ones? Before technical part, the first
thing we need is to give a chronological definition of time. Usually there 
are three eras in the history of philosophy, Ancient era, Medieval era, and 
Modern era. Modern era is further divided into early modern era and late modern 
era. The latter sometimes is called 19th-century philosophy. All works after it
is considered Contemporary philosophy. Based on this general chronology, this
article divides all works into four categories: **Ancient** (all works before 5th
century), **Medieval** (between 5th and 16th century), **Modern** (between 
17th and 19th century), and **Contemporary** (after 19th century).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sentence_amount <- philosophy_selected %>%
  group_by(author, title) %>%
  count(original_publication, name = "sentence_amount") %>%
  arrange(original_publication)
write.csv(sentence_amount, 
          file = "../output/sentence_amount.csv",row.names=FALSE)

kable(head(sentence_amount, 5))

rm(sentence_amount)
```

Noticeably, the table above ordered by original publication year indicates
that no work falls in **Medieval** category, so there will be only three categories
for all analyses related time in this article.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
philosophy_selected_category <- philosophy_selected %>%
  mutate(category = case_when(
    original_publication >= 1900 ~ "Contemporary",
    original_publication >= 1500 ~ "Modern",
    TRUE ~ "Ancient"
  ))
write.csv(philosophy_selected_category, 
          file = "../output/philosophy_selected_category.csv",row.names=FALSE)

rm(philosophy_selected)
```

Once category division is finished, the technical part comes. We want to know the 
general distribution of sentence length over the category. In order to check if
there exists any trend, box plots with path line is our choice.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
philosophy_selected_g3 <- philosophy_selected_category %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarize(mean_length = mean(length))

g3 <- ggplot(philosophy_selected_category, aes(x=category, y=length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_path(data = philosophy_selected_g3, 
            aes(x=category, y=mean_length, group=1))

ggsave("g3.png", path="../figs")

g3

rm(g3)
```

Whoops! It seems that there are too many outliers within all three categories,
so we decide to cut off all sentences containing more than 500 words. Notice
that we only drop those sentences in box plot for better visualization. The path
line will be untouched.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
philosophy_selected_category_filtered <- philosophy_selected_category %>%
  filter(length <= 500)

g4 <- ggplot(philosophy_selected_category_filtered, 
             aes(x=category, y=length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_path(data = philosophy_selected_g3, 
            aes(x=category, y=mean_length, group=1))

ggsave("g4.png", path="../figs")

g4

rm(philosophy_selected_g3); rm(g4)
```

It's clearer that recent works tend to have longer sentences on average than the 
classical ones. This trend is revealed in the whole distribution, not only a
couple of metrics such as median and mean.

Someone may come up with such **a follow-up question**: is it possible that the
increasing trend of sentence length is due to the school rather than time directly?
We also make such a graph. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find a plausible trend among all schools, since some schools can be discussed in
different time.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
g5 <- ggplot(philosophy_selected_category_filtered, 
             aes(x=school, y=length, color = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()

ggsave("g5.png", path="../figs")

g5

rm(philosophy_selected_category_filtered); rm(g5)
```

Now we come to **the second question**: do more recent works criticize the 
classical or contemporary works more frequently? If we define "criticize" as "mention 
the authors from earlier or the same era", a reasonable assumption to this 
question is "Yes," as the successors are expected to cite from the precusors, 
or they may just discuss previous topics in the society at their time. However,
once we count all mentions of each sentence and sum them up, we can not find a 
clear trend. It's true that Ancient works seldom mention other authors
due to 
time limit and author limit, but Contemporary works have much more fewer mentions
than Modern works. A plausible explanation is that the amount of works in the 
database are different over the time. An alternative criterion is to use appearance
rate to make a comparison, but taking account the fact that the amount of mentions
vary among many other factors such as author and sentence length (and don't
forget that the latter also relates to time!), the process will be too complex
for an article for general audience. Hence, we only compare amounts here.

**The last question** follows a similar process, but this time the comparison
is more reliable because the data is more balanced when we discuss the school.
Among all 13 schools, the analytic and continental school have authors who like 
mentioning other authors most; the phenomenology school forms a single cluster; 
the german_idealism, communism, and rationalism school composes the third cluster, 
while all the rest schools tend not to make a comparison or citation from others in 
their works.
